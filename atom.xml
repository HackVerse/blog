        <title>HackVerse 4.0 Theme</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Cody was excited; they knew that the time of the year had arrived for the most anticipated hackathon, HackVerse 4.0. Cody had been a part of HackVerse for years now and had seen the theme change every year. Last year, it was all about space, and Cody had a blast exploring the galaxy and meeting some of the brightest minds in the world of coding.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Eager. Excited. Nervous. Which one of them do you relate to? All of them? Relax, relax. I too relate to the first two. Yes, you guessed it right, it’s Cody again!

        <title>HackVerse 3.0: FUTURE IN SPACE</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Beep, beep, beep … the sound of sirens kept amplifying with every beep. Cody slowly opened their eyes. Around them were creatures they had not seen before, and they looked at Cody with relieved and welcoming expressions. There were wires connecting Cody to very sophisticated machines, and it suddenly struck them that they were not where they were meant to be. Something about the creatures reminded them of their friends on Earth, but Cody realised that they were elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
