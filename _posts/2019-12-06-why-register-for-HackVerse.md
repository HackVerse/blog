## 1.Most importantly to have FUN
Be it the adrenaline rush during the last 15 minutes of coding, meeting like-minded geeks, NITK’s private beach, a plethora of cultural events, some really fun activities at night or the lush greenery spread across 300 acres, you will have something to enjoy every moment here.

## 2. You win, or you learn
No one coming here will leave empty-handed. More importantly, however, you get to interact with the best coders from all over India and observe their ideas, thought process and approach. It is a fantastic opportunity to broaden your mind and learn a lot, be it the state-of-the-art technology or the newest libraries in the field of your choice.

## 3. Boost your resume
Most companies and startups prefer enthusiastic students who have built innovative solutions using the latest technologies to solve real-world problems. The prototype you exhibit here, could potentially boost your resume and enable you to stand apart from the crowd

## 4. Cash prizes, (Food)
Self-explanatory, isn’t it? (Anyways, to satisfy your curiosity, we are excited to inform that we already have  worth of prices lined up)   

## 5. Network, network, and network
Hackathons are a great place to meet like-minded people and exchange ideas, insights and collaborate. To ensure that you do not end up like the people above, HackVerse has introduced a trademark event called Meet-and-Greet. This session will be completely dedicated to meeting other participants and mentors. You can meet new people, make new friends, get to listen to different perspectives, clarify your doubts and get guidance from industry experts. In short, this session is aimed to help you build a strong network with people across all regions, fields, and experience, which we believe will help you in the long run, even after the hackathon is over.  

So what are you waiting for!!! Unleash your coding skills and show us that you deserve to be here.
