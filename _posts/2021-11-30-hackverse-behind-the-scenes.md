With the second edition of HackVerse, HackVerse 2.0, done and dusted for the year, it's time to look back on the event and reminisce on all the good - and bad - experiences. 


## Let's take a look at what the people involved in making it such a huge success have to say!

"I had an amazing experience being a part of the organizing team, especially because of the amazing teammates (both batchmates and juniors). Everyone was supportive of each other and that's what really holds the team spirit high." -Nishant Kumar, Operations Head, SR Head

"Organizing HackVerse 2.0 was an amazing experience. Personally, I got to work with people who are motivated to organize the event, manage huge tasks and be part of planning one of the biggest online hackathons. As part of the team, we saw amazing ideas come to life and being implemented by the team. We wanted HackVerse to be one of a kind experience to the participants." 
-K Rahul Reddy, Lead Organizer	

"HackVerse 2.0 happened under extraordinary circumstances. We had to deal with a lot of uncertainties and questions while planning for the event. Personally, I've learnt quite a bit about sponsor and vendor negotiations. The best part is the amazing feedback we've received from our participants regarding the event."
-Madhumitha Nara, Lead Organizer


The way HackVerse was pulled off is certainly something to be very proud of, but behind every success story lies a great deal of effort. Let's take a quick trip behind the scenes to peek at some of the challenges the team had to overcome.

"We did bring up a lot of companies for the marketing team with the help of my contacts, but really couldn't turn them up into potential sponsors. The companies which we approached, were not ready for sponsoring as they were hit by the pandemic too."
-Laksh Sadhwani, Student Relations Team	

"Typical shortcomings of an online event, everything is done in front of a computer, which drains out people, resulting in less casual interactions with everyone. However convenient it may be, organizing an online event can never come close to an offline event, where you talk to people (organizers, participants, caretakers, vendors, guests etc.), and not usernames/phone numbers."
-Nishant Kumar, Operations Head, SR Head

"One difficulty is, even after finalizing the theme, making the design and art style/asthetic of the materials we make uniform. As there will be multiple people working on the designs, finding the right balance of maintaining restrictions/templates while giving creative freedom to get the best outcome. For online event, we did use a lot of new platforms for our events and publicity as well so, trying to maximize our presence through custom design like having our custom theme based banners on webinars, appropriate versions of our logos in different places could be a challenge."
-Aditya Gourishetty, Media Head

"We had a lot of challenges, the biggest one was to connect with the team, keep everyone in loop and organize the event online.Since the event was not offline, we did not have a lot of physical logistics to plan for, but this also came with a cost of not having good marketing points. We had to improvise to attract sponsors."
-K Rahul Reddy, Lead Organizer

"One of the biggest challenges is student engagement. Our mission was to empower student developers and support the existing community across India by providing them a common platform. Online interaction has made it difficult although we've done the best we can, thanks to all the creative ideas and effort put in by the team."
-Madhumitha Nara, Lead Organizer 

"Good experience, sadly it was online. Working with a team of people you haven't met before is difficult. Faced issues in getting judges and speakers for the event. Verification of project was a bit difficult and so was judging. Keeping people engaged was an issue online compared to offline."
-Vybhav Pai, Tech team lead


Despite these numerous challenges, the team not only rose to the challenge, but blew all expectations out of the water and exceeded them. And so, let's listen to the advice they have to offer. 

"Work with friends/befriend the people you need to work with. More than the event itself, it's about the experience of organizing such a big event. Have fun. Don't be afraid to try things. More often than not, these mistakes while trying out new things won't have any long term negative effects. So, chill out."
-Nishant Kumar

"Probably instead of keeping a single design for repetitive tasks, keeping a design which can be tweaked with ease to introduce some simple uniqueness. This would lessen the monotony atleast a little bit and draw some more attention. Also, very important- keeping a well structured,shared and editable backups of all the work we do. Decide upon a well defined plan and timeline for the work and stick to it. Also regarding media try to be a bit passionate about the work your work and reflect upon others' opinion appropriately with relevance to your original idea."
-Aditya Gourishetty	

"I've learnt from the team that people start working on an idea only when they truly believe in it. And in teams like HackVerse, every team member needs to understand why they are doing what they are doing. Keep in mind what is really important. It is very easy to lose track of what's the most important part of something we are working on. Be it a meet, a collaboration, or the entire event, make sure you have the big picture in mind and keep steering the right way.

1. Plan well for the event timeline.
2. Keep the work well distributed.
