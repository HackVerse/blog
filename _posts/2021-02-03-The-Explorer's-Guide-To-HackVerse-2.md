The HackVerse 2.0 mascot, Cody will guide you on your journey.

Hello HackVerse aspirants!
I’m Cody, your favourite underwater mascot and I’m here to help you out on your exciting underwater voyage, from the dock of registration to the starboard of results. Hold your breath...


`` CHECKPOINT 1 : 
# THE DOCK OF REGISTRATION ``

To participate, form a team of 2 to 3 people. 
Can’t find teammates? Don’t worry, you can still register individually, and find other participants who have also individually registered later on to team up with.

Each aspirant, whether a member of a team or not, has to fill in the application form. 

READY OR NOT? DIVE IN!


`` CHECKPOINT 2 :
# GET ACQUAINTED WITH A DEEP SEA CREATURE, THE APPLICATION FORM``

Go to the [HackVerse Website](https://hackverse.nitk.ac.in/), and click the ‘Apply with Devfolio’ button.

You will then be directed to create an account/login on Devfolio.

Upon signing up/logging in, you will be directed to the HackVerse dashboard on Devfolio. Click ‘Continue to the application’ to go to the HackVerse application form. This application is what will be reviewed by the HackVerse team for the initial filtering of participants, so do fill it carefully!

There are two sections of the application, one occupying the top half of the page, the other, the bottom. The first section pertains to the necessary paperwork - things required by us, from you, formally. There are five subsections in this section - About, Education, Experience, Links, and Contact. You can move to the next subsection only after completing the current subsection by clicking the ‘Next: <subsection>’ button. You can move back to a previous subsection any time by clicking the ‘Previous: <subsection>’ button.

`` CHECKPOINT 3 :
# YOU’RE NEARING YOUR DESTINATION! FLAP YOUR FLIPPERS AND DIVE DEEPER... ``

Once you’ve completed the first section, move to the second section - the one where you give us an idea of your hacking expertise. Upon filling the fields in this section, tick the checkboxes at the bottom of the page to complete the application.

</p>

At this point, there are two roads to choose from:
* If you’re applying as a team, click the ‘Join or create team’ button. One of the team members would be required to create a team by providing a team name, and would then obtain a team code. The other team members would use this code to join the team.
* If you’re applying individually (and form a team with other individual participants later on), click the ‘Submit individual application’ button.

AH! THERE IT IS! THE ELUSIVE SUBMARINE.

`` 
# --- You have successfully completed your mission. Wait for further instructions --- ``


`` CHECKPOINT 4 :
# ENJOY THE VIEW FROM THE STARBOARD! ``

The procedure of filtering applications will begin in a couple of weeks after the applications start rolling in. If you’re shortlisted for the hackathon, you will receive an email stating the good news from Devfolio.

A few days before the hackathon, a Discord server will be created, where you and the other shortlisted participants will be added. Here is where the fun starts - workshops, talks from eminent industry experts, and other fascinating events. During these interactions, participants who have registered individually would be required to team up with other individual registrants.



`` CHECKPOINT 5 :
# DATE: 27TH FEBRUARY 2021 ``
THE HACKVERSE 2.0 SUBMARINE IS LOADED AND READY TO EXPLORE THE UNSEEN... 

You and your team will battle it out with the other teams in a race to create the most unique hack. Leaders in the industry will be among those present to judge each team’s submission. Submissions will be open to the community, for promoting the ideas of impartiality and fairness.


`` CHECKPOINT 6 :
# DATE: 28TH FEBRUARY 2021
# ..AND THUS, THE LAST UNEXPLORED FRONTIER ON EARTH WAS CONQUERED. ``

Results will be announced a few days after the hackathon, followed by the Prize distribution ceremony and Hackerman felicitation.

Uncovering the secrets of the deep sea is no small task, and we hope that you will persevere until the end. Never stop dreaming; never stop exploring!


**IT’S TIME TO RISE TO THE SURFACE.**
