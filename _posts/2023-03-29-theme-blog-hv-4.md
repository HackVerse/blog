Cody was excited; they knew that the time of the year had arrived for the most anticipated hackathon, HackVerse 4.0. Cody had been a part of HackVerse for years now and had seen the theme change every year. Last year, it was all about space, and Cody had a blast exploring the galaxy and meeting some of the brightest minds in the world of coding.

But this year, something was different; Cody felt a certain chill in the air. They couldn't help but wonder what the new theme for HackVerse would be.

As Cody arrived at the venue, they noticed that everything had transformed into a summer paradise. There were palm trees, colourful flowers, and beach chairs all over the place. Cody was taken aback - never had they witnessed anything like this before. As they made their way to the main stage, they noticed a group of people huddled together, whispering among themselves.

Cody's curiosity was piqued, and they couldn't resist eavesdropping. They overheard snippets of conversation that hinted at something different from the summer paradise around them. "I heard we have to prepare for sub-zero temperatures," one person said. "I saw a polar bear roaming around earlier," another added.

Cody's heart began to race - what was going on? They tried to ask the people around, but they just smiled and told them to wait and see.

Finally, Cody’s dearest friends, the organisers of HackVerse, arrived. Cody felt a sense of relief. Maybe they would finally reveal what was going on. But instead of telling Cody and the other participants what the theme was, they handed Cody a clue.

The clue was cryptic, but Cody was a smart little guy. They studied it for a moment before the realization hit him like a ton of bricks. The Arctic! The theme for this year's HackVerse was going to be the Arctic!

Cody's excitement knew no bounds. They knew that this was going to be an unforgettable experience, one that would test everyone’s limits and push them to be the best that they could be. And with a sense of renewed vigour, Cody set out to explore everything that HackVerse 4.0 had to offer.

From coding challenges to brainstorming sessions, from networking events to keynote speeches, Cody made the most of every opportunity. And as they looked around, they realised that they were surrounded by some of the brightest minds in the world of coding, all of them working together to create solutions that could change the world.

Cody closed their eyes, merging into the surroundings. They knew that they would always cherish the memories of HackVerse 4.0, the most incredible hackathon yet. They were finally back with the people they considered family, doing what they loved the most; Cody was finally back home.
