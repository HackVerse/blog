Repository for the HackVerse Blog

### Author Pages

In order to properly generate author pages you need to rename the field *author* in the
front matter of every post to match that of your each author's *username* as defined
in the *[\_data/authors.yml](_data/authors.yml)* file.
With the latest update, multiple author blogs are now supported out of the box.

### Compiling 

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/hackverse/blog/
cd blog/
bundle exec jekyll build
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
